# DEW-POINT-METER-
Dew Point Meter is designed to measure the performance of drying systems for compressed air, nitrogen and other compressed gases. Dew Point Analyzer Model is ideal for monitoring medical, commercial and industrial applications including plastics resin dryers, breathing air, pneumatic tools, instrument air, and spraying/coating applications. You can use this  dew point Analyzer instrument continuously up to 90 hours without low battery indication. Dew point Analyzer measures dew point analyzer by utilizing microprocessor circuitry to convert  sensor signal by the use of psychometric equations. Assembled in a rugged hand held IP‚Äê 65 protected plastic enclosure and equipped with quick disconnect tubing couplings and an internal  sensor manifold. An orifice maintains line pressure for true pressure dew point meter readings we are using Dew Point meter for Compressed air.   #d
